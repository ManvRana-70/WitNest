# ⚡️ WitNest — Mega Blog Under the Wolf’s Skin 🐺

Welcome to **WitNest**, the blog platform that doesn’t just whisper stories — it howls them.  
Built with a sleek React frontend and powered by Appwrite in the shadows, this beast is wrapped in Redux muscle and cyberpunk soul.

> _“No account? No content. This blog bites back.”_

## 🧠 What’s Under the Hood

This isn’t your average blog setup. It’s a modular, scalable, and slightly rebellious stack designed for creators who like their code clean and their content loud.

- 📝 **TinyMCE** — Rich text editor with just enough chaos.
- 🧩 **React Hook Form** — Form validation that feels like magic.
- 🔄 **Redux** — State management with bite.
- ⚛️ **React** — The backbone of the frontend.
- 🛡️ **Appwrite** — Backend services that guard your data like a cybernetic wolfpack.
